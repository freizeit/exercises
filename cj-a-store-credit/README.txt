You receive a credit C at a local store and would like to buy two items. You first walk through the store and create a list L of all available items. From this list you would like to buy two items that add up to the entire value of the credit.
The solution you provide will consist of the two integers indicating the positions of the items in your list (smaller number first).  

The test cases are contained in a file (see e.g. `A-large-practice.in`) whose path is to be specified on the command line. The caller may also specify the number of CPU cores to use.
